# PykaDex DSi
A [PykaDex](https://github.com/PykaDex) repository being used as a concept Idea to use the Nintendo DSi as functioning pokedex
Base code for dsi camera forked from [dsi-camera](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/dsi-camera).

Hope to use the dsi as a means of capturing images an interacting with our API (once API is working) using wifi.
Still lots to be developed.


# DSi camera test (Forked README)

This is an example app for using the DSi's Cameras. Currently it can show both cameras and save a picture as photo.bmp.
